# Playtest protocol and recording format (v1)

The contract between the director (`tools/playtest`) and the two game
hosts: the port (`Revenant --control=stdio`) and the emulator's play slot
(`tools/retail_runtime/slots/play/server.py`). Both hosts implement it
exactly; [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) explains why it looks this way.

All text is UTF-8 JSON, one object per line, `\n`-terminated. Integers are
JSON numbers. Unknown fields are ignored by readers, so fields can be added
without a version bump; removing or changing one bumps `rvrec`/`protocol`.

## 1. Time

- **Tick**: one 24 Hz world update. Retail: one firing of the
  `timeSetEvent` callback and one pass of the screen loop. Port: one
  `TScreen::Pulse` (`--fixedstep` gives one per frame).
- **Session tick** `t`: ticks since play started (`start`). `t = 0` is the
  first tick after the start state is in place.
- An event for tick `t` is delivered before tick `t` updates, in file
  order, at one point per host: the port's input-queue drain just before
  `CurrentScreen->Tick()`, the emulator's tick boundary before it fires
  the timer callback.
- **Lockstep**: under a host's control channel, one tick is one frame (one
  update, one draw), and nothing advances between requests.

## 2. Input events

Every event has a time key (`t`, or `f` under frame timing, §4) and exactly
one of:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"key": NAME, "down": bool` | a key down or up. `NAME` is a Windows virtual-key name without `VK_`: `A`–`Z`, `0`–`9`, `F1`–`F12`, `LEFT` `RIGHT` `UP` `DOWN` `HOME` `END` `PRIOR` (Page Up) `NEXT` (Page Down) `INSERT` `DELETE` `RETURN` `ESCAPE` `SPACE` `BACK` `TAB` `SHIFT` `CONTROL` `MENU` (Alt), `NUMPAD0`–`NUMPAD9`, `OEM_*`, or a code as `"0x5D"`. Chords are separate events: `CONTROL` down, `A` down, `A` up, `CONTROL` up |
| `"char": CODE` | a character (`WM_CHAR`), as its Windows-1252 code: `13` Enter, `8` Backspace, `27` Escape, `97` `a`. Typed text, save names and the text-bar prompt read characters, not keys |
| `"mouse": [X, Y], "buttons": MASK` | the whole pointer state after the event: position in 640x480 game-screen pixels and the held buttons (bit 0 left, bit 1 right, bit 2 middle). Hosts derive move, down and up from the change from the previous state. Pointer state starts at `[320, 240]`, no buttons |

Hosts never synthesize input of their own, apart from the start rules in
§5. Character translation is not implied: a typed letter is a `key` down,
a `char`, and a `key` up, as Windows delivers it.

## 3. Check lines

```json
{"t": 240, "check": {"screen": "play", "level": 2, "pos": [6280, 4338, 33],
  "facing": 96, "health": 87, "mana": 40, "fatigue": 70, "action": 2,
  "target": {"pos": [6301, 4350, 33], "health": 30}, "draws": 18342}}
```

Written by a recording host every 24 ticks, at every mark, and at the end.
A check line at tick `t` is the state at that tick's boundary: after `t`
ticks have run (with, in lockstep, the `t` frames that drew them) and
before tick `t`'s events are delivered; `t = 0` is the start state. Under
frame timing a frame can run no tick or several, so the line goes at the
first frame boundary at or after each multiple of 24, with the tick it
reached.

| Field | Source (port / retail) |
|---|---|
| `screen` | `title`, `loading`, `play`, `menu`, `dialog`, `death`, `movie`, `other` |
| `level` | the player's map level |
| `pos` | the player's world position, integers |
| `facing` | the player's facing, 0–255 |
| `health`, `mana`, `fatigue` | current values |
| `action` | the player's `doing` action number (retail numbering, PLAYER_INPUT.md §3) |
| `target` | the player's fight target's position and health, or `null` |
| `draws` | draws from the game's random stream since start: the port's `RandomDraws()`; the emulator's count of calls to the CRT `rand` `0x0058c582` (`random()` `0x00483300` draws through it only when its bounds differ, as the port's does, and 32 other callers draw directly, as the port's `GameRand()` users do) |

A replay compares each check line field by field and stops at the first
tick with a difference, reporting the fields that differ. Fields a host
can't produce are omitted, and comparisons skip fields missing on either
side.

## 4. The recording: `*.rvrec`

Line 1 is the header; then events, check lines and marks in tick order;
the last line is the end.

```json
{"rvrec": 1, "game": "port", "build": {"sha": "…", "name": "feature/playtest@599264bf", "patches": ["clickwalk"]},
 "start": {"from": "slot", "slot": "Keep after opening", "slot_sha": "…"},
 "ini_sha": "…", "seed": 1, "tick_hz": 24, "screen": [640, 480],
 "timing": "lockstep", "created": "2026-10-10T21:30:00Z", "by": "director 0.1"}
```

| Header field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `game` | `port` or `retail` |
| `build.sha` | port: the git commit; retail: the executable's SHA-256 |
| `build.name`, `build.patches` | human-readable build and the behaviour patches it carries (`clickwalk`) |
| `start.from` | `newgame` (retail `QUICKSTART`, port `--quickstart`: the opening plays) or `slot` |
| `start.slot`, `start.slot_sha` | the slot's name and the SHA-256 of its directory (§6) |
| `ini_sha` | SHA-256 of the `Revenant.ini` used |
| `seed` | the game random seed (port `--seed`; the emulator's CRT seed) |
| `timing` | `lockstep` or `frames` |

Body lines:

- events (§2), keyed by `t` under `lockstep`;
- under `frames`, each display frame opens with `{"f": N, "dt": "HEX"}`,
  the frame's exact time step as the 16 hex digits of its IEEE-754 double,
  and the events delivered before that frame's ticks follow it, keyed by
  `"f": N`. Check lines still use `t`;
- check lines (§3);
- marks: `{"t": T, "mark": KIND, …}`, for example
  `{"t": 300, "mark": "quicksave", "slot": "Quick Save 1"}` or
  `{"t": 420, "mark": "milestone", "name": "rahul dead"}`. Marks are notes:
  replay ignores them except to compare the check line written with them;
- the end: `{"t": T, "end": true}`, the tick count reached.

A recording is self-contained only with its **bundle**, a directory:

```
<name>/
  session.rvrec       the recording
  Revenant.ini        the INI used (its SHA is ini_sha)
  start/<slot>/       the start slot, when start.from is "slot"
  session.rvlog       director notes: questions, answers, costs (optional)
  frames/             PNGs the director asked for (optional)
```

## 5. The control channel

Requests are `{"id": N, "cmd": NAME, …}`; each gets exactly one response,
`{"id": N, "ok": true, …}` or `{"id": N, "ok": false, "error": "…"}`, in
order. A host writes nothing else on its stdout. Logs go to files and
stderr.

| `cmd` | Request fields | Response fields |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | | `game`, `build`, `protocol: 1`, `tick_hz`, `screen`, `capabilities` (list of the optional commands it implements) |
| `start` | `from`, `slot` (a bundle `start/` path when `from` is `slot`), `seed`, `record` (bundle directory, optional), `ini` (path, optional) | `t: 0` once play is reached and control can be given |
| `step` | `ticks`, `events` (each with `t` relative to this step, `0 <= t < ticks`) | `t`: the session tick reached |
| `observe` | `frame` (PNG path, optional), `objects` (radius in world units, default 800), `walkgrid` (radius, optional) | the observation (§7) |
| `project` | `points`: `[[x, y, z], …]` | `screen`: `[[sx, sy] or null, …]`: game-screen pixels, `null` when off the play field; `world`: `[bool, …]`, whether a click at each reaches the world rather than the HUD or a modal (the port's `TPlayScreen::ClickRoute`; the retail host's is retail's own routing, which also gives the map pane a press over the status and text bars; a host without it omits it). A click's map point is taken at Locke's height + 50, so project a point to click at that height |
| `pick` | `x`, `y` | `pos`: the map point under that pixel by the game's pointer conversion (the right-button walk's: Locke's height + 50), `object`: the id under it or `null`, `world`: whether a click there reaches the world. The retail host answers `pos` and `world`, not `object`: retail finds the object under a point with its 3D pick, which draws a whole frame and changes the game's pick cache, so asking would change the game. Every drawn frame picks under the pointer, though, so the object under the pointer is the observation's `cursor` (§7): move the pointer there, step a tick, observe |
| `export_slot` | `slot` (a slot name, or `@last` for the slot the game wrote most recently: Quick Save picks its own "Quick Save N"), `to` | `path`, `slot` (the name exported) |
| `mark` | `kind`, other fields | writes the mark and a check line to the recording |
| `replay` | `bundle`, `verify` (bool), `until` (tick, optional) | `t`, and with `verify`: `diverged: null` or `{t, fields}`. A replay starts the way the recording did: a new game, or the bundle's own `start/<slot>` with its seed and INI |
| `exec` | `command`: a console command (the game's CommandInterpreter, player as context: `player.pos x y z level`, `set STATE 1`) | `result`: its result code. Port only; refused while recording (it changes the game outside its input). For test setup: placing Locke, story states |
| `checkpoint`, `restore` | `name` | retail only |
| `caption` | `text` (one or two short lines; empty clears) | shown to a person watching (§5a); never part of the game, the frame `observe` captures or the recording |
| `quit` | | ends the recording with its end line and exits |

`start` is the only command that may run ticks of its own: loading,
entering the world, and for `newgame` nothing else. The opening's scenes
then run under `step` like everything else.

A replay boots its own game from the bundle's start, as the recording's
host did, so the port answers `replay` only in place of `start`, in a
fresh host: a process that has run a game is no longer in the state the
recording started from.

## 5a. Watching

A person can watch either game while the director plays. Watching never
changes what the game does: it only adds waiting between ticks and pixels
outside the game's own frame.

| | Port | Emulator |
|---|---|---|
| see the game | `--control=stdio` without `--headless`: the game window | `server.py --watch DIR`: after every tick, the front buffer as `DIR/frame.png` (written to a temporary name, then renamed), and `DIR/caption.txt` |
| real speed | `--control-pace=24`: stepped ticks no faster than 24 a second | `--pace 24`: the same |
| captions | drawn over the window | in `caption.txt`, for the viewer |
| the viewer | optional `--watch-frames=DIR`: the same `frame.png` per tick, for the viewer page | `tools/playtest/watch.py DIR` |

`tools/playtest/watch.py` serves a page with the live frame, the caption,
and the director's decisions as they happen.

## 6. Slot hashing

`slot_sha` is the SHA-256 of, for each file under the slot directory in
sorted order of its relative path (`/`-separated, lower case), the path,
a NUL byte, the file's bytes and a NUL byte.

```

- `control`: the player has control (scripts and scenes turn it off).
- `player.mode`: `normal`, `combat`, `bow`, `sneak`.
- `action_name`: the name on the character's `doing` action block (an
  animation or attack name, e.g. `atkchop`, the names char.def's ATTACK
  lines use); `action_tick`: ticks since that block started. With
  char.def's `impacttime` and `blocktime`, the director tells a wind-up
  from an impact or a recovery.
- `target` (player and characters): the id of the character it fights, or
  `null`; the player's id in `objects` is `0`.
- `xp`: character level, experience, experience for the next level.
  `attacklevel`: AttackLevel (stat 20), the gate on an attack's
  `attackskill` (IsValidAttack; Jong's lessons raise it, [GRIND.md](GRIND.md)
  §2.3). `stats`: the six attributes, modified (equipment and stat
  effects applied, capped at 30).
- `skills`: every skill as `[level, experience, experience for its next
  level]` (stats 40-50, 51-61, 62-72), the level modified as the
  attributes are. `weapon.skill` names the skill a kill with the weapon in
  hand raises and its to-hit adds (stat 43 + WeaponType: `hands`
  barehanded); `weapon.mask` is char.def's weapon mask bit for the weapon
  in hand (`WM_*`), `0` bare-handed.
- `levelup`: the two attributes the next level-up raises (0 Strn .. 5 Luck)
  and the cursor the Stats page's `train*` buttons write through.
- `combat`: Offense, Defense, Armour and Damage as the game computes them
  (the stat sheet's Atk, Def, Armour and Dmg).
- `effect`: the stat effect in force (one at a time), its STATLINE as words
  and the ticks till it ends (`null` for one without `TIME`); `null` with
  none.
- `items`: every item the player carries, wherever it is: the pack (slots
  0-254), worn and wielded (256 + `EQ_*`), the belt (267-277), and inside
  bags, with `bag` the slots of the bags it is in, outermost first (left out
  at the top level). Each has `amount`, `eqslot` and `stats`, the numbers
  for its class, read as the game reads them (`GetStat` by name, lower
  cased): a weapon's `type`, `damage`, `minstrength`, `value`; an armour's
  `protection`, `minstrength`, `minconstitution`, `value`; food's and a
  potion's `health`, `mana`, `poison`; none for other classes.
- `equip_slots`: the screen centre of each equipment slot's cell on the
  equip pane, by `EQ_*` slot, `null` while the side panel doesn't show the
  pane (an entry `null` where a press can't reach it). A drag from a cell
  to the pack unequips. `belt_boxes`: in step with `belt`, the centre of the
  box showing each belt slot, `null` where no box shows it; `null` while the
  bottom bar is hidden.
- `quick_spells`, `belt`: what the four quick-spell slots (F1-F4) and the
  five belt slots (F5-F9) hold, `null` when empty: a spell by its spell.def
  VARIANT name, an item by its name.
- Names are the game's own (instance, type, spell variant names: what the
  .def files and scripts use), never display text.
- `pack`: the player's items in the inventory pane's twelve cells in view:
  slot, name, class (lower case), `eqslot` (the item's own equipment slot,
  its EqSlot stat; -1 for none) and the cell's screen centre (`null` while
  the pane is hidden). A right click there equips the item in its own slot
  (PLAYER_INPUT.md §6). `equipped`: equipment slot (player.h `EQ_*`) to the
  item worn or wielded there.
- `cursor`: the id of the object under the pointer as the last drawn
  frame picked it, `null` for nothing (the player is `0`): what a left
  click there acts on (retail `TMapPane::OnObject`, which reuses the pick
  every frame makes at the pointer; the port's hover pick, the same
  function). `null` too while the pointer is off the map (the retail
  host: outside the map pane; the port: on its HUD). A host leaves it out
  when it can't say without changing the game (retail: no frame has drawn
  since the pointer moved). To act on an object, a director moves the
  pointer onto it, steps a tick, checks `cursor`, then clicks.
- `messages`: text-bar lines added since the previous `observe`.
- `objects`: within the radius, nearest first: characters, items,
  containers, exits and doors, waypoint helpers. `name` is the instance
  name, `type` the object type name (char.def's CHARACTER names for
  characters), `class` the object class name in lower case (`character`,
  `item`, `container`, `exit`, `helper`, …), and `screen` is `null` off
  screen. Left out: tiles, shadows, effects, carried items, and what the
  player can't see or click, an object flagged `INVISIBLE` or `EDITOR`
  (object flags bits 7 and 8), except the waypoint helpers. A script
  holder such as keep.s's `MUDOKON` is one of these, and so is a character
  a script has hidden (`toggle invisible = 1`). A character has `value`,
  its class Value (what a kill earns and its to-hit go by, GRIND §1.2), and
  `dead` (health below 1: a corpse). Anything else has `amount` when it is
  a pile of more than one; an item (anything that can be carried) `item`,
  its `amount`, `eqslot` and `stats` as in `items`; a container `open`
  (its state), `openable` (a use opens it), `locked`, and `contents`, each
  item it holds as `{slot, name, amount}` (a use takes one).
- `walkgrid` (when asked): `{"origin": [gx, gy], "cell": 16, "w": W,
  "h": H, "heights": [...]}`, row-major walk heights: 0 for no floor, -1 for
  a cell no loaded sector holds (unknown, not "no floor"). Cell k is centred
  on world k*16, as `GetWalkHeight` reads it (`(x + 8) >> 4`). The hosts
  agree on every cell both know; the port knows the whole loaded map (a
  cell no sector of it covers is 0), the retail host only the sectors in
  retail's pool.
- `player.radius`: the radius the game tests Locke's steps over
  (`GetWalkHeightRadius`).

Raw numbers only: bucketing for Jev is the director's job.
