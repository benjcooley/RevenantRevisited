sokol_gfx.h -- simple 3D API wrapper

    Project URL: https://github.com/floooh/sokol

    Example code: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-samples

    Do this:
        #define SOKOL_IMPL or
        #define SOKOL_GFX_IMPL
    before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
    implementation.

    In the same place define one of the following to select the rendering
    backend:
        #define SOKOL_GLCORE33
        #define SOKOL_GLES2
        #define SOKOL_GLES3
        #define SOKOL_D3D11
        #define SOKOL_METAL
        #define SOKOL_WGPU
        #define SOKOL_DUMMY_BACKEND

    I.e. for the GL 3.3 Core Profile it should look like this:

    #include ...
    #include ...
    #define SOKOL_IMPL
    #define SOKOL_GLCORE33
    #include "sokol_gfx.h"

    The dummy backend replaces the platform-specific backend code with empty
    stub functions. This is useful for writing tests that need to run on the
    command line.

    Optionally provide the following defines with your own implementations:

    SOKOL_ASSERT(c)             - your own assert macro (default: assert(c))
    SOKOL_UNREACHABLE()         - a guard macro for unreachable code (default: assert(false))
    SOKOL_GFX_API_DECL          - public function declaration prefix (default: extern)
    SOKOL_API_DECL              - same as SOKOL_GFX_API_DECL
    SOKOL_API_IMPL              - public function implementation prefix (default: -)
    SOKOL_TRACE_HOOKS           - enable trace hook callbacks (search below for TRACE HOOKS)
    SOKOL_EXTERNAL_GL_LOADER    - indicates that you're using your own GL loader, in this case
                                  sokol_gfx.h will not include any platform GL headers and disable
                                  the integrated Win32 GL loader

    If sokol_gfx.h is compiled as a DLL, define the following before
    including the declaration or implementation:

    SOKOL_DLL

    On Windows, SOKOL_DLL will define SOKOL_GFX_API_DECL as __declspec(dllexport)
    or __declspec(dllimport) as needed.

    If you want to compile without deprecated structs and functions,
    define:

    SOKOL_NO_DEPRECATED

    Optionally define the following to force debug checks and validations
    even in release mode:

    SOKOL_DEBUG         - by default this is defined if _DEBUG is defined

    sokol_gfx DOES NOT:
    ===================
    - create a window or the 3D-API context/device, you must do this
      before sokol_gfx is initialized, and pass any required information
      (like 3D device pointers) to the sokol_gfx initialization call

    - present the rendered frame, how this is done exactly usually depends
      on how the window and 3D-API context/device was created

    - provide a unified shader language, instead 3D-API-specific shader
      source-code or shader-bytecode must be provided (for the "official"
      offline shader cross-compiler, see here:
      https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/blob/master/docs/sokol-shdc.md)

    STEP BY STEP
    ============
    --- to initialize sokol_gfx, after creating a window and a 3D-API
        context/device, call:

            sg_setup(const sg_desc*)

    --- create resource objects (at least buffers, shaders and pipelines,
        and optionally images and passes):

            sg_buffer sg_make_buffer(const sg_buffer_desc*)
            sg_image sg_make_image(const sg_image_desc*)
            sg_shader sg_make_shader(const sg_shader_desc*)
            sg_pipeline sg_make_pipeline(const sg_pipeline_desc*)
            sg_pass sg_make_pass(const sg_pass_desc*)

    --- start rendering to the default frame buffer with:

            sg_begin_default_pass(const sg_pass_action* action, int width, int height)

        ...or alternatively with:

            sg_begin_default_passf(const sg_pass_action* action, float width, float height)

        ...which takes the framebuffer width and height as float values.

    --- or start rendering to an offscreen framebuffer with:

            sg_begin_pass(sg_pass pass, const sg_pass_action* action)

    --- set the pipeline state for the next draw call with:

            sg_apply_pipeline(sg_pipeline pip)

    --- fill an sg_bindings struct with the resource bindings for the next
        draw call (1..N vertex buffers, 0 or 1 index buffer, 0..N image objects
        to use as textures each on the vertex-shader- and fragment-shader-stage
        and then call

            sg_apply_bindings(const sg_bindings* bindings)

        to update the resource bindings

    --- optionally update shader uniform data with:

            sg_apply_uniforms(sg_shader_stage stage, int ub_index, const sg_range* data)

        Read the section 'UNIFORM DATA LAYOUT' to learn about the expected memory layout
        of the uniform data passed into sg_apply_uniforms().

    --- kick off a draw call with:

            sg_draw(int base_element, int num_elements, int num_instances)

        The sg_draw() function unifies all the different ways to render primitives
        in a single call (indexed vs non-indexed rendering, and instanced vs non-instanced
        rendering). In case of indexed rendering, base_element and num_element specify
        indices in the currently bound index buffer. In case of non-indexed rendering
        base_element and num_elements specify vertices in the currently bound
        vertex-buffer(s). To perform instanced rendering, the rendering pipeline
        must be setup for instancing (see sg_pipeline_desc below), a separate vertex buffer
        containing per-instance data must be bound, and the num_instances parameter
        must be > 1.

    --- finish the current rendering pass with:

            sg_end_pass()

    --- when done with the current frame, call

            sg_commit()

    --- at the end of your program, shutdown sokol_gfx with:

            sg_shutdown()

    --- if you need to destroy resources before sg_shutdown(), call:

            sg_destroy_buffer(sg_buffer buf)
            sg_destroy_image(sg_image img)
            sg_destroy_shader(sg_shader shd)
            sg_destroy_pipeline(sg_pipeline pip)
            sg_destroy_pass(sg_pass pass)

    --- to set a new viewport rectangle, call

            sg_apply_viewport(int x, int y, int width, int height, bool origin_top_left)

        ...or if you want to specifiy the viewport rectangle with float values:

            sg_apply_viewportf(float x, float y, float width, float height, bool origin_top_left)

    --- to set a new scissor rect, call:

            sg_apply_scissor_rect(int x, int y, int width, int height, bool origin_top_left)

        ...or with float values:

            sg_apply_scissor_rectf(float x, float y, float width, float height, bool origin_top_left)

        Both sg_apply_viewport() and sg_apply_scissor_rect() must be called
        inside a rendering pass

        Note that sg_begin_default_pass() and sg_begin_pass() will reset both the
        viewport and scissor rectangles to cover the entire framebuffer.

    --- to update (overwrite) the content of buffer and image resources, call:

            sg_update_buffer(sg_buffer buf, const sg_range* data)
            sg_update_image(sg_image img, const sg_image_data* data)

        Buffers and images to be updated must have been created with
        SG_USAGE_DYNAMIC or SG_USAGE_STREAM

        Only one update per frame is allowed for buffer and image resources when
        using the sg_update_*() functions. The rationale is to have a simple
        countermeasure to avoid the CPU scribbling over data the GPU is currently
        using, or the CPU having to wait for the GPU

        Buffer and image updates can be partial, as long as a rendering
        operation only references the valid (updated) data in the
        buffer or image.

    --- to append a chunk of data to a buffer resource, call:

            int sg_append_buffer(sg_buffer buf, const sg_range* data)

        The difference to sg_update_buffer() is that sg_append_buffer()
        can be called multiple times per frame to append new data to the
        buffer piece by piece, optionally interleaved with draw calls referencing
        the previously written data.

        sg_append_buffer() returns a byte offset to the start of the
        written data, this offset can be assigned to
        sg_bindings.vertex_buffer_offsets[n] or
        sg_bindings.index_buffer_offset

        Code example:

        for (...) {
            const void* data = ...;
            const int num_bytes = ...;
            int offset = sg_append_buffer(buf, &(sg_range) { .ptr=data, .size=num_bytes });
            bindings.vertex_buffer_offsets[0] = offset;
            sg_apply_pipeline(pip);
            sg_apply_bindings(&bindings);
            sg_apply_uniforms(...);
            sg_draw(...);
        }

        A buffer to be used with sg_append_buffer() must have been created
        with SG_USAGE_DYNAMIC or SG_USAGE_STREAM.

        If the application appends more data to the buffer then fits into
        the buffer, the buffer will go into the "overflow" state for the
        rest of the frame.

        Any draw calls attempting to render an overflown buffer will be
        silently dropped (in debug mode this will also result in a
        validation error).

        You can also check manually if a buffer is in overflow-state by calling

            bool sg_query_buffer_overflow(sg_buffer buf)

        You can manually check to see if an overflow would occur before adding
        any data to a buffer by calling

            bool sg_query_buffer_will_overflow(sg_buffer buf, size_t size)

        NOTE: Due to restrictions in underlying 3D-APIs, appended chunks of
        data will be 4-byte aligned in the destination buffer. This means
        that there will be gaps in index buffers containing 16-bit indices
        when the number of indices in a call to sg_append_buffer() is
        odd. This isn't a problem when each call to sg_append_buffer()
        is associated with one draw call, but will be problematic when
        a single indexed draw call spans several appended chunks of indices.

    --- to check at runtime for optional features, limits and pixelformat support,
        call:

            sg_features sg_query_features()
            sg_limits sg_query_limits()
            sg_pixelformat_info sg_query_pixelformat(sg_pixel_format fmt)

    --- if you need to call into the underlying 3D-API directly, you must call:

            sg_reset_state_cache()

        ...before calling sokol_gfx functions again

    --- you can inspect the original sg_desc structure handed to sg_setup()
        by calling sg_query_desc(). This will return an sg_desc struct with
        the default values patched in instead of any zero-initialized values

    --- you can inspect various internal resource attributes via:

            sg_buffer_info sg_query_buffer_info(sg_buffer buf)
            sg_image_info sg_query_image_info(sg_image img)
            sg_shader_info sg_query_shader_info(sg_shader shd)
            sg_pipeline_info sg_query_pipeline_info(sg_pipeline pip)
            sg_pass_info sg_query_pass_info(sg_pass pass)

        ...please note that the returned info-structs are tied quite closely
        to sokol_gfx.h internals, and may change more often than other
        public API functions and structs.

    --- you can ask at runtime what backend sokol_gfx.h has been compiled
        for, or whether the GLES3 backend had to fall back to GLES2 with:

            sg_backend sg_query_backend(void)

    --- you can query the default resource creation parameters through the functions

            sg_buffer_desc sg_query_buffer_defaults(const sg_buffer_desc* desc)
            sg_image_desc sg_query_image_defaults(const sg_image_desc* desc)
            sg_shader_desc sg_query_shader_defaults(const sg_shader_desc* desc)
            sg_pipeline_desc sg_query_pipeline_defaults(const sg_pipeline_desc* desc)
            sg_pass_desc sg_query_pass_defaults(const sg_pass_desc* desc)

        These functions take a pointer to a desc structure which may contain
        zero-initialized items for default values. These zero-init values
        will be replaced with their concrete values in the returned desc
        struct.

    ON INITIALIZATION:
    ==================
    When calling sg_setup(), a pointer to an sg_desc struct must be provided
    which contains initialization options. These options provide two types
    of information to sokol-gfx:

        (1) upper bounds and limits needed to allocate various internal
            data structures:
                - the max number of resources of each type that can
                  be alive at the same time, this is used for allocating
                  internal pools
                - the max overall size of uniform data that can be
                  updated per frame, including a worst-case alignment
                  per uniform update (this worst-case alignment is 256 bytes)
                - the max size of all dynamic resource updates (sg_update_buffer,
                  sg_append_buffer and sg_update_image) per frame
                - the max number of entries in the texture sampler cache
                  (how many unique texture sampler can exist at the same time)
            Not all of those limit values are used by all backends, but it is
            good practice to provide them none-the-less.

        (2) 3D-API "context information" (sometimes also called "bindings"):
            sokol_gfx.h doesn't create or initialize 3D API objects which are
            closely related to the presentation layer (this includes the "rendering
            device", the swapchain, and any objects which depend on the
            swapchain). These API objects (or callback functions to obtain
            them, if those objects might change between frames), must
            be provided in a nested sg_context_desc struct inside the
            sg_desc struct. If sokol_gfx.h is used together with
            sokol_app.h, have a look at the sokol_glue.h header which provides
            a convenience function to get a sg_context_desc struct filled out
            with context information provided by sokol_app.h

    See the documention block of the sg_desc struct below for more information.


    UNIFORM DATA LAYOUT:
    ====================
    NOTE: if you use the sokol-shdc shader compiler tool, you don't need to worry
    about the following details.

    The data that's passed into the sg_apply_uniforms() function must adhere to
    specific layout rules so that the GPU shader finds the uniform block
    items at the right offset.

    For the D3D11 and Metal backends, sokol-gfx only cares about the size of uniform
    blocks, but not about the internal layout. The data will just be copied into
    a uniform/constant buffer in a single operation and it's up you to arrange the
    CPU-side layout so that it matches the GPU side layout. This also means that with
    the D3D11 and Metal backends you are not limited to a 'cross-platform' subset
    of uniform variable types.

    If you ever only use one of the D3D11, Metal *or* WebGPU backend, you can stop reading here.

    For the GL backends, the internal layout of uniform blocks matters though,
    and you are limited to a small number of uniform variable types. This is
    because sokol-gfx must be able to locate the uniform block members in order
    to upload them to the GPU with glUniformXXX() calls.

    To describe the uniform block layout to sokol-gfx, the following information
    must be passed to the sg_make_shader() call in the sg_shader_desc struct:

        - a hint about the used packing rule (either SG_UNIFORMLAYOUT_NATIVE or
          SG_UNIFORMLAYOUT_STD140)
        - a list of the uniform block members types in the correct order they
          appear on the CPU side

    For example if the GLSL shader has the following uniform declarations:

        uniform mat4 mvp;
        uniform vec2 offset0;
        uniform vec2 offset1;
        uniform vec2 offset2;

    ...and on the CPU side, there's a similar C struct:

        typedef struct {
            float mvp[16];
            float offset0[2];
            float offset1[2];
            float offset2[2];
        } params_t;

    ...the uniform block description in the sg_shader_desc must look like this:

        sg_shader_desc desc = {
            .vs.uniform_blocks[0] = {
                .size = sizeof(params_t),
                .layout = SG_UNIFORMLAYOUT_NATIVE,  // this is the default and can be omitted
                .uniforms = {
                    // order must be the same as in 'params_t':
                    [0] = { .name = "mvp", .type = SG_UNIFORMTYPE_MAT4 },
                    [1] = { .name = "offset0", .type = SG_UNIFORMTYPE_VEC2 },
                    [2] = { .name = "offset1", .type = SG_UNIFORMTYPE_VEC2 },
                    [3] = { .name = "offset2", .type = SG_UNIFORMTYPE_VEC2 },
                }
            }
        };

    With this information sokol-gfx can now compute the correct offsets of the data items
    within the uniform block struct.

    The SG_UNIFORMLAYOUT_NATIVE packing rule works fine if only the GL backends are used,
    but for proper D3D11/Metal/GL a subset of the std140 layout must be used which is
    described in the next section:


    CROSS-BACKEND COMMON UNIFORM DATA LAYOUT
    ========================================
    For cross-platform / cross-3D-backend code it is important that the same uniform block
    layout on the CPU side can be used for all sokol-gfx backends. To achieve this,
    a common subset of the std140 layout must be used:

    - The uniform block layout hint in sg_shader_desc must be explicitely set to
      SG_UNIFORMLAYOUT_STD140.
    - Only the following GLSL uniform types can be used (with their associated sokol-gfx enums):
        - float => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_FLOAT
        - vec2  => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_FLOAT2
        - vec3  => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_FLOAT3
        - vec4  => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_FLOAT4
        - int   => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_INT
        - ivec2 => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_INT2
        - ivec3 => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_INT3
        - ivec4 => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_INT4
        - mat4  => SG_UNIFORMTYPE_MAT4
    - Alignment for those types must be as follows (in bytes):
        - float => 4
        - vec2  => 8
        - vec3  => 16
        - vec4  => 16
        - int   => 4
        - ivec2 => 8
        - ivec3 => 16
        - ivec4 => 16
        - mat4  => 16
    - Arrays are only allowed for the following types: vec4, int4, mat4.

    Note that the HLSL cbuffer layout rules are slightly different from the
    std140 layout rules, this means that the cbuffer declarations in HLSL code
    must be tweaked so that the layout is compatible with std140.

    The by far easiest way to tacke the common uniform block layout problem is
    to use the sokol-shdc shader cross-compiler tool!


    BACKEND-SPECIFIC TOPICS:
    ========================
    --- The GL backends need to know about the internal structure of uniform
        blocks, and the texture sampler-name and -type. The uniform layout details
        are  described in the UNIFORM DATA LAYOUT section above.

            // uniform block structure and texture image definition in sg_shader_desc:
            sg_shader_desc desc = {
                // uniform block description (size and internal structure)
                .vs.uniform_blocks[0] = {
                    ...
                },
                // one texture on the fragment-shader-stage, GLES2/WebGL needs name and image type
                .fs.images[0] = { .name="tex", .type=SG_IMAGETYPE_ARRAY }
                ...
            };

    --- the Metal and D3D11 backends only need to know the size of uniform blocks,
        not their internal member structure, and they only need to know
        the type of a texture sampler, not its name:

            sg_shader_desc desc = {
                .vs.uniform_blocks[0].size = sizeof(params_t),
                .fs.images[0].type = SG_IMAGETYPE_ARRAY,
                ...
            };

    --- when creating a shader object, GLES2/WebGL need to know the vertex
        attribute names as used in the vertex shader:

            sg_shader_desc desc = {
                .attrs = {
                    [0] = { .name="position" },
                    [1] = { .name="color1" }
                }
            };

        The vertex attribute names provided when creating a shader will be
        used later in sg_create_pipeline() for matching the vertex layout
        to vertex shader inputs.

    --- on D3D11 you need to provide a semantic name and semantic index in the
        shader description struct instead (see the D3D11 documentation on
        D3D11_INPUT_ELEMENT_DESC for details):

            sg_shader_desc desc = {
                .attrs = {
                    [0] = { .sem_name="POSITION", .sem_index=0 }
                    [1] = { .sem_name="COLOR", .sem_index=1 }
                }
            };

        The provided semantic information will be used later in sg_create_pipeline()
        to match the vertex layout to vertex shader inputs.

    --- on D3D11, and when passing HLSL source code (instead of byte code) to shader
        creation, you can optionally define the shader model targets on the vertex
        stage:

            sg_shader_Desc desc = {
                .vs = {
                    ...
                    .d3d11_target = "vs_5_0"
                },
                .fs = {
                    ...
                    .d3d11_target = "ps_5_0"
                }
            };

        The default targets are "ps_4_0" and "fs_4_0". Note that those target names
        are only used when compiling shaders from source. They are ignored when
        creating a shader from bytecode.

    --- on Metal, GL 3.3 or GLES3/WebGL2, you don't need to provide an attribute
        name or semantic name, since vertex attributes can be bound by their slot index
        (this is mandatory in Metal, and optional in GL):

            sg_pipeline_desc desc = {
                .layout = {
                    .attrs = {
                        [0] = { .format=SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT3 },
                        [1] = { .format=SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT4 }
                    }
                }
            };

    WORKING WITH CONTEXTS
    =====================
    sokol-gfx allows to switch between different rendering contexts and
    associate resource objects with contexts. This is useful to
    create GL applications that render into multiple windows.

    A rendering context keeps track of all resources created while
    the context is active. When the context is destroyed, all resources
    "belonging to the context" are destroyed as well.

    A default context will be created and activated implicitly in
    sg_setup(), and destroyed in sg_shutdown(). So for a typical application
    which *doesn't* use multiple contexts, nothing changes, and calling
    the context functions isn't necessary.

    Three functions have been added to work with contexts:

    --- sg_context sg_setup_context():
        This must be called once after a GL context has been created and
        made active.

    --- void sg_activate_context(sg_context ctx)
        This must be called after making a different GL context active.
        Apart from 3D-API-specific actions, the call to sg_activate_context()
        will internally call sg_reset_state_cache().

    --- void sg_discard_context(sg_context ctx)
        This must be called right before a GL context is destroyed and
        will destroy all resources associated with the context (that
        have been created while the context was active) The GL context must be
        active at the time sg_discard_context(sg_context ctx) is called.

    Also note that resources (buffers, images, shaders and pipelines) must
    only be used or destroyed while the same GL context is active that
    was also active while the resource was created (an exception is
    resource sharing on GL, such resources can be used while
    another context is active, but must still be destroyed under
    the same context that was active during creation).

    TRACE HOOKS:
    ============
    sokol_gfx.h optionally allows to install "trace hook" callbacks for
    each public API functions. When a public API function is called, and
    a trace hook callback has been installed for this function, the
    callback will be invoked with the parameters and result of the function.
    This is useful for things like debugging- and profiling-tools, or
    keeping track of resource creation and destruction.

    To use the trace hook feature:

    --- Define SOKOL_TRACE_HOOKS before including the implementation.

    --- Setup an sg_trace_hooks structure with your callback function
        pointers (keep all function pointers you're not interested
        in zero-initialized), optionally set the user_data member
        in the sg_trace_hooks struct.

    --- Install the trace hooks by calling sg_install_trace_hooks(),
        the return value of this function is another sg_trace_hooks
        struct which contains the previously set of trace hooks.
        You should keep this struct around, and call those previous
        functions pointers from your own trace callbacks for proper
        chaining.

    As an example of how trace hooks are used, have a look at the
    imgui/sokol_gfx_imgui.h header which implements a realtime
    debugging UI for sokol_gfx.h on top of Dear ImGui.

    A NOTE ON PORTABLE PACKED VERTEX FORMATS:
    =========================================
    There are two things to consider when using packed
    vertex formats like UBYTE4, SHORT2, etc which need to work
    across all backends:

    - D3D11 can only convert *normalized* vertex formats to
      floating point during vertex fetch, normalized formats
      have a trailing 'N', and are "normalized" to a range
      -1.0..+1.0 (for the signed formats) or 0.0..1.0 (for the
      unsigned formats):

        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_BYTE4N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_UBYTE4N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT2N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_USHORT2N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT4N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_USHORT4N

      D3D11 will not convert *non-normalized* vertex formats to floating point
      vertex shader inputs, those can only be uses with the *ivecn* vertex shader
      input types when D3D11 is used as backend (GL and Metal can use both formats)

        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_BYTE4,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_UBYTE4
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT2
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT4

    - WebGL/GLES2 cannot use integer vertex shader inputs (int or ivecn)

    - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_UINT10_N2 is not supported on WebGL/GLES2

    So for a vertex input layout which works on all platforms, only use the following
    vertex formats, and if needed "expand" the normalized vertex shader
    inputs in the vertex shader by multiplying with 127.0, 255.0, 32767.0 or
    65535.0:

        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT2,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT3,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_FLOAT4,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_BYTE4N,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_UBYTE4N,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT2N,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_USHORT2N
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_SHORT4N,
        - SG_VERTEXFORMAT_USHORT4N


    MEMORY ALLOCATION OVERRIDE
    ==========================
    You can override the memory allocation functions at initialization time
    like this:

        void* my_alloc(size_t size, void* user_data) {
            return malloc(size);
        }

        void my_free(void* ptr, void* user_data) {
            free(ptr);
        }

        ...
            sg_setup(&(sg_desc){
                // ...
                .allocator = {
                    .alloc = my_alloc,
                    .free = my_free,
                    .user_data = ...,
                }
            });
        ...

    If no overrides are provided, malloc and free will be used.

    This only affects memory allocation calls done by sokol_gfx.h
    itself though, not any allocations in OS libraries.


    LOG FUNCTION OVERRIDE
    =====================
    You can override the log function at initialization time like this:

        void my_log(const char* message, void* user_data) {
            printf("sg says: \s\n", message);
        }

        ...
            sg_setup(&(sg_desc){
                // ...
                .logger = {
                    .log_cb = my_log,
                    .user_data = ...,
                }
            });
        ...

    If no overrides are provided, puts will be used on most platforms.
    On Android, __android_log_write will be used instead.

    COMMIT LISTENERS
    ================
    It's possible to hook callback functions into sokol-gfx which are called from
    inside sg_commit() in unspecified order. This is mainly useful for libraries
    that build on top of sokol_gfx.h to be notified about the end/start of a frame.

    To add a commit listener, call:

        static void my_commit_listener(void* user_data) {
            ...
        }

        bool success = sg_add_commit_listener((sg_commit_listener){
            .func = my_commit_listener,
            .user_data = ...,
        });

    The function returns false if the internal array of commit listeners is full,
    or the same commit listener had already been added.

    If the function returns true, my_commit_listener() will be called each frame
    from inside sg_commit().

    By default, 1024 distinct commit listeners can be added, but this number
    can be tweaked in the sg_setup() call:

        sg_setup(&(sg_desc){
            .max_commit_listeners = 2048,
        });

    An sg_commit_listener item is equal to another if both the function
    pointer and user_data field are equal.

    To remove a commit listener:

        bool success = sg_remove_commit_listener((sg_commit_listener){
            .func = my_commit_listener,
            .user_data = ...,
        });

    ...where the .func and .user_data field are equal to a previous
    sg_add_commit_listener() call. The function returns true if the commit
    listener item was found and removed, and false otherwise.
